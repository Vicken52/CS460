# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Objectives

* Homework 1 solution and discussion
* Homework 2 clarification
* Understand Dijkstra's algorithm
* Implement Dijkstra's algorithm
* Understand difference of BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm
* Quiz 1 announcement

## Metrics/Desired Outcomes

* Homework 2 ready to start
* Able to implement Dijkstra's algorithm
* Able to apply DijkStra's algorithm to find shortest path for weighted graph

### Homework 1 Common Problems

1. General
    * Definition of `adjacent(x, y)`  
    > Adjacent of x and y means that there is edge from x to y and there may not be edge from y to x.
1. AdjacencyList
    * Utilize `equals` method (that can be used in `contain`)
2. AdjacencyMatrix
    * Forgot to adjuce the size of `nodes` and `adjacencyMatrix` 
    * Assigning 1 to as edge value (regardless of the actual edge value from graph-2)
    * `Id` and `index` confusion
