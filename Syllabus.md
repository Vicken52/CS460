# Artificial Intelligence

## Course Overview

- **Objective** The primary objective of this course is to introduce knowledge representation, problem solving and learning methods of Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, students will be learning how to apply such techniques into  games.
- **Expectation** Students are expected to have Java programming background as the entire course will be primary taught in Java. In addition, students are expected to devote a large amount of time learning how to implement algorithms learned in class.

## Logistics

- **Instructor** Hsiang-Yu (Eric) Liao [rcliao01@gmail.com](mailto:rcliao01@gmail.com) and John J. Tran
- **Lecture** Saturday 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM
- **Office Hours** Saturday 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
- **Location** E&T A126
- **Text Book** None as we will have all notes hosted on Github.

## Course Objectives

* Knowledge Representation (Graph, Node and Edge)
* Brute force searching algorithm (DFS & BFS)
* Heuristic searching algorithm (A*)
* Alpha-Beta pruning
* Min-Max

## Grading Allocation

1. Quiz (4) 40 pts
2. Homework (4) 40 pts
3. Course Project 20 pts
